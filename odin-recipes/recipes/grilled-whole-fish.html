        <h3>Grilled Whole Fish</h3>

          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            Grilling a whole fish is much easier than grilling it in smaller
            pieces. Plus, I think a whole grilled fish looks and tastes better,
            too. I like to use branzino, a delicious Mediterranean fish, but
            this method works with other whole fish as well.

          <h4>Ingredient</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne</li>
            <li>1 whole branzino (about 1.25 pounds), scaled and gutted</li>
            <li>3 whole chives</li>
            <li>2 sprigs tarragon</li>
            <li>2 sprigs Italian parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large lemon, quartered</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Step 1: Mix salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne
              together in small bowl to make seasoning salt.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 2: Place the fish on a large piece of parchment paper.
              Generously season the inside cavity of the fish with the seasoning
              salt. Stuff chives, tarragon, and parsley into the cavity, making
              sure everything’s tucked inside. Brush the outside of the fish
              with olive oil, and season both sides generously with the salt
              mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 3: Wrap fish up in parchment paper and chill in the
              refrigerator for about 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Fish
              can also be grilled immediately if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 4: Meanwhile, build a small charcoal fire in your grill, and
              let it burn until the coals are almost all white. If necessary,
              move some of the coals away from the center, so the heat is not
              too intense directly under the fish.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 5: Carefully place the stuffed fish onto the grill. Grill on
              the first side for about 4 minutes, then carefully flip over.
              Grill the second side for about 4 minutes. If temperature is too
              hot, grill can be covered with the vent open during cooking time
              to lower the temperature of the coals. Once both sides of the fish
              have browned, you can carefully turn it back and forth every few
              minutes until fish is cooked to the desired doneness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 6: Check for doneness with a thermometer. The internal
              temperature in the thickest part of the fish should read 135
              degrees F (57 degrees C). Remove the fish from the grill and serve
              with fresh lemon wedges.
