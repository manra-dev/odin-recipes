          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            Chef John's pasta alla caponata turns a famously delicious Sicilian
            vegetable relish, caponata, into a fabulously delicious pasta sauce.
            With eggplant, capers, and pine nuts in a rich tomato sauce, this
            pasta dish is incredible. If you have leftovers—and you probably
            won't—it makes a great cold summer pasta salad, too, with just an
            added splash of olive oil.

            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 cups crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>8 basil leaves, torn</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated pecorino cheese</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Step 1: Peel off half the eggplant skin in strips using a peeler,
              and cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes. Add eggplant cubes to a
              large bowl and sprinkle over 1 tablespoon kosher salt; toss
              thoroughly. Let sit for 20 minutes on the counter, tossing
              occasionally. Transfer into a strainer, rinse lightly with cold
              water, and drain very well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 2: Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil
              over high heat. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring
              occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 3: Add oil to a skillet and place over medium heat. Add
              garlic cloves; when they start to sizzle, swirl the oil for about
              30 seconds. Remove garlic and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 4: Turn the heat to high, and add eggplant to the skillet.
              Cook, stirring, until eggplant loses its firmness and just starts
              to become tender, about 6 minutes. Turn off the heat. Set a
              strainer over a bowl; transfer eggplant into the strainer. Pour
              any olive oil that drains into the bowl back into the skillet, and
              place skillet back over medium-high heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 5: Add onions, celery, and peppers to the skillet, and cook
              and stir for a few minutes until onions are translucent, and
              vegetables begin to soften. Add pinenuts, red pepper flakes,
              capers, and reserved garlic cloves, and cook and stir for 1 minute
              more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 6: Stir in sugar and vinegar; cook, stirring for another
              minute. Add eggplant back into the skillet; cook and stir until
              eggplant is almost tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes
              and a small splash of water, and cook, stirring for about 3
              minutes. Reduce heat to low.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 7: Transfer cooked pasta with a strainer into the finished
              sauce. Add a ladle or 2 of pasta water as needed to thin the
              sauce. Turn off the heat, and stir in torn basil leaves. Grate a
              small amount of pecorino on top to serve.
